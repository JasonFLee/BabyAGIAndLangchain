Grazes on \nshort turf grasses and low \nshrubs of the savannah. \n \nLifespan : 25 to 30 years in the \nwild; up to 45 years in zoos \n \nSize : Length 13 to 17 feet.  \nHeight 5-7 feet.  Weight 3200 to \n8000 pounds \n \nBehavior :  Often cover \nthemselves with a layer of mud  \nthat acts as both bug repellant  \nand sun block. Usually sociable, placid and even-te mpered.  Because they are \nvery near-sighted, they often charge when startled.   Dominant bulls are usually \nsolitary and will confront any invading bull.  Whit e rhinos tend to congregate into \na small family group in a loosely defined territory .  Adult males are territorial.  \nMostly diurnal, spending ½ day feeding, 1/3 day res ting, and the remainder \nwalking around, standing alert, or wallowing.  They  are most active at dawn and \ndusk. A high step trot is normally the fastest gait  at 18 mph.  They have the ability \nto gallop at 25 to 30 mph. \n  \nA white rhino will drink twice a day if water is av ailable, but if conditions are dry it \ncan live for four or five days without drinking. Do minant bulls mark their territory \nwith excrement and urine.  The dung is laid in well -defined piles, called middens; \nthere may be 20 to 30 middens to mark a given terri tory. As pure grazers, white \nrhinos play an integral part in the southern Africa n grassland ecosystem.  Seed \ndispersal and the hindering of woody plant encroach ment are important parts of \ntheir role in the grasslands.', metadata={'source': 'data/rhino.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='3  \nAdaptations : Thick skin, like armor, to move thru thorny shrub s. Wide, square \nshaped mouth with flexible broad lips for “mowing” grasses.  Their short legs, \nlong head reaching almost to the ground, and wide m outh are used in \ncombination with a side-to-side head movement to ea t massive quantities of \ngrass.  Rhinos lack canines and incisors. Rhinos ha ve excellent hearing.  They \nwill swivel their ears to pinpoint sound; the ears move independently and are \nusually in motion. Acute sense of smell.  The olfac tory passages which are \nresponsible for smell are larger than their entire brain. Rhinos have a massive \nhump of muscle on their necks, to hold up a large h ead that can weigh 800 to \n1000 pounds.  A rhino’s horn is not a true horn tha t is attached to the skull.  It \ngrows from the skin and is made up of keratin fiber s, the same material found in \nhair and nails. Rhinos generally have no natural pr edators due to their massive \nsize and tough skin; however the young may be preye d on by large carnivores.  \nRhinos are perissodactyls (odd toed ungulates), wit h three toes.  The middle toe \nsupports most of their weight. \n \nReproduction : Gestation is 17 to 18 months.  Females reproduce only every 2 \n½ to 5 years.  Their single calf does not live on i ts own until it is about 3 years \nold.  Females reach sexual maturity at 6 years; mal es at 10 to 12 years. \n \nStatus :  CITES: Appendix II  \nIUCN: Near Threatened (Southern population) \n \nThree of the five species -- the (Indian, Javan and  Sumatran Black Rhinoceros) -- \nare critically endangered, as is the Northern White . The Southern White is \nregistered as Vulnerable, with roughly 14,500 remai ning in the wild. \n \nThe northern population is critically endangered an d may be extinct in the wild. \n \nDuring the European exploration of Africa, the whit e rhino was actually less \nnumerous than the black rhino.  Today, because of c areful management in the \nRepublic of South Africa, the southern white rhino population has increased \ndramatically.  South Africa is home to about 80% of  the world’s population of \nwhite rhinos.', metadata={'source': 'data/rhino.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='4 \n \n \nThreats to Rhinoceros Survival  \n \n• Poaching for the horn, skin, and meat- The horn is used for traditional \nart and medicine.  However, there has been no scien tific evidence of \nhealth benefits. In an effort to protect rhinos, so me preserves remove \nrhino horns to deter poachers. \n \n“The unfounded rumour that rhino horn can cure \ncancer most likely sealed the fate of the last \nJavan rhino in Vietnam. This same problem is \nnow threatening other rhino populations across \nAfrica and South Asia.” – Dr. A. Christy Williams, \nWWF, Rhino horn demand leads to record poaching  \n \n \n• Habitat destruction and urbanization \n \n \n• Drought - The drought kills the plants on \nwhich rhinos browse; since white rhinos do \nnot have a large home range, a widespread \ndrought can be devastating.   \n \n• Human Conflict -Political disruptions in some African countries ha ve \nweakened many conservation efforts.  \n \n \nWhy should we care if the Rhino goes extinct?   \nThe rhinoceros is one of the largest land mammals i n the world.  It coexists \npeacefully with other species other than man within  its habitats around the world.', metadata={'source': 'data/rhino.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='5 \n \n \nWhat can I do to help Rhinos?  \n \n• Support eco-tourism.  Species like the rhino can be saved if their touri sm \nvalue is used to help them coexist with human popul ations . \n• Support breeding programs in zoos . Through the efforts of \ngovernments and zoos (like the ABQ BioPark!), the S outhern white \nrhinoceros is recovering in numbers.   \n•  Don’t buy products made with rhino horn.   \n \nSources: Smithsonian magazine, Wikipedia, CITES web site \n \n \nLearn more at: http://www.rhinoconservation.org/', metadata={'source': 'data/rhino.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='6', metadata={'source': 'data/rhino.pdf', 'page': 5})]
